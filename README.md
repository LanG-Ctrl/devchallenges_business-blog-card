<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project is a solution to the **Business Blog Card** challenge on [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io). It is a fully responsive card design showcasing an image, overlay, and text, styled with modern CSS techniques.

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me:
- Gain a deeper understanding of positioning in CSS, particularly using `position: absolute` and `relative` for overlay effects.
- Explore the usage of `Flexbox` for centering content vertically and horizontally.
- Understand better techniques for creating responsive layouts with scalable properties like `width: 100%`.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me align and center the card effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) - Provided clarity on how `absolute` and `relative` positioning interact.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge. Its primary features include:
- Fully responsive design
